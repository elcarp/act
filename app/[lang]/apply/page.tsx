            An ACT counseling license is a credential granted by the Accredited
            Counselors of Thailand (ACT) to qualified counselors in Thailand who
            meet the criteria. The purpose of obtaining an ACT counseling
            license is to ethically provide counseling services in accordance
            with international standards. A licensed counselor refers to a
            professional who has met the standard requirements regarding
            education, training, and ethical standards in providing counseling
            services. In other countries, this is sometimes called a registered
            counselorâ€”the terms registered and licensed are interchangeable. An
            accredited counselor goes one step further: this is a highly
            experienced counselor who has held a license for at least five years
            and has made significant contributions to the mental health field.
